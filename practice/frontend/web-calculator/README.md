# Frontend Practice - Calculator with History

## What I built
A simple web calculator that:
- Performs add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Takes two numbers as input
- Shows the result
- Displays the last 5 calculations
- Handles divide-by-zero errors

## How to run
Open this file in a browser:
- `practice/frontend/web-calculator/src/index.html`

## What I learned
- Basic HTML form structure and semantic layout
- Styling with CSS grid and custom properties
- DOM selection and event handling in JavaScript
- Input validation and error handling
- Rendering and limiting list history in the UI
